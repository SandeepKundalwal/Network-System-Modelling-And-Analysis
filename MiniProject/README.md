# [EE580: Network System: Modelling \& Analysis] Mini Project : Consensus Problem in Network of Agents

Reference [10] is a seminal work on consensus of multi-agent networks. Present the results outlined here for networks with fixed topologies, and illustrate the results with appropriate examples and simulations.
